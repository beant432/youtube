Use StrictMode to enable additional development behaviors and warnings for the component tree inside:

Strict Mode checks only run in development, they help you find bugs that already exist in your code but can be tricky to reliably reproduce in production. Strict Mode lets you fix bugs before your users report them.


to setup tailwind
-  npm i -D @tailwindcss
- npx tailwind init ( it creates tailwind.config.js)
- in tailwind.config.js write content: ["./src/**/*.js"],
- in app.css write
 @tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

rafce- to create functional components

useSearchParam- we can use get\\\


higher order component- a functioonn that takes a component and return a component
- takes exsisting component andd return modified component


debouncing- 
typing slow- 200 ms - difference bew key strokes
typing fast - 50 ms- difference bew key strokes

perfomace - iphone pro max= 14 letter- 1000 people - will make 14000 calls
with debouncong- 3 api calls- 3000 call
skipping some of the event. when we are typing very fast

debouncing applied with 200ms - flipcart
if difference bw 2 key stoke is less than <200 ms- should not call api- decline 
if >200 make an api call

add casche in redux


time compleexity
find/Search element in array - O(n)
find/Search  element in Object/Map - O(1)
array.indexOf()= O(n)
array.includes= O(n)

but if we store in object - O(1)- using hash map
{
    ip:'ip',
    'iphi':'ipho'
}
new Map()


LRU cache-  Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.- limit cache keys once limit exceeds statrt removing from top

n level nested comments- youtube offer 2 time
in reddit nested comments- we can use recusrive component inside 

live chat >>>>> infinite scroll >>>>> pagination


fetch data live- 
web sockets (stock market- trading app, whatsapp)- 2 way connection between serverr and UI- UI->-<Server (after no regular interval)- need real time data
API polling (gmail, crickbuzz, youtube) - UI request frpm server  dat aflows frrrom  server to UI (after some regular interval)- data is unidirectional- no need of real time data

youtube remove comments from top 

//
usememo- increase perfomance - cache results value by re-render
usecallback
useref
useparams- provoided by react-router

usecallback- increase perfomance - cache results function  by re-render

useref- let you rreference a value that is not needed for re-rendering
ref renturns a object (dooesn't return value)
ref={current:""};
